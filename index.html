            <p>Hello, my username is Minjie.  I am playing to become a better person at Plant Earth server. I believe knowledge is the key to a better world. The belief was formed through out my way levelling up from primary school, middle school and university. I was trained mostly in science and technology and I love that. I had the dream of becoming an Engineer and build things back in my childhood, and I am glad all the choices I have made lead me to this path.</p> 
            <p>There are always better things.</p>
            <p>I started programming for work from early 2015. The work includes data processing, graphical visualisation and full stack web development. Since that, I am fascinated by the world of coding. I realised the potential of software products to make everybody's life better, just like how machines did in past two centuries.</p>
            <p>There are always better things yet to come.</p>
